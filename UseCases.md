## Use Case Paragraphs

#### 1: Lai Wei
Search for contact is a function that can allow users to find their desired contacts who are already stored in their contact list. This function  provides a convenient way for users to find the contacts stored in the contact list. Users don’t have to look up the contacts one  by one in their contact list. Instead, they can simply type in the name of the contact desired and the results will be displayed.

#### 2: Jesus
Store name card info is a function in which mobile phone camera scans a business card and saves its contents such as: the business name, person’s name, address, and contact information. The Actor would place the name card in front of the camera (with the card holders information facing up) and the device will detect the information and store it automatically in a local database. If the card is unreadable or some information is missing, the user will be asked to type it in. This function is useful for busy people who often misplace business cards, or who forget about important events or connections with a person.

#### 3: Satoe
Send notification is a function to remind users to reach out their contacts on set time, birthday, or a few days after a meeting. This is built in to take the hassle away from the user to remember to write thank you cards or birthday cards to their professional contacts that they would like to maintain in their network. We are thinking about providing templates for users to choose from, so that we can maximize convenience for our users. By keeping track of the last time of communication, we will provide users with the option of how frequently they would like to reach out. This way, we can remind our users to reach out in a timely fashion that keeps a tight network with maximum efficiency.

#### 4: Yifan
Location Service is an essential part of our application. Users will not only be able to search for others users, store information, get notifications, but also locate their professional contacts in a real-time map. This function will be very useful when the user wants to get a sense about how far he or she is away from his or her target contact people. Moreover, a ‘nearby me’ feature is set up for the benefit of the users to locate contacts near their current geographic locations so that it gets more easier to find people and get in touch with them.

#### 5: Lai Wei
Authenticate User is a function that helps user to create an account on our web application. When the user first visit our website, they will need to create a new account name with a password. After this process, users can start to store the contacts they want under their accounts. This function is necessary because users will have different personal contacts and that is a good way to store users’ own personal contacts.
