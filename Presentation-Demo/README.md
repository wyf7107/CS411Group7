BEFORE RUNNING THE SERVER:

***Make Sure You Have Chrome and Using Chrome To Run****

1. Go to chrome and add this extension(cuz the API is foreign) https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en
2. Unzip zip file you should get a folder 411project
3. Open terminal, cd to 4111 project, and hit 'npm run dev'
//If you can run npm, you should install it first/////
4. Open a chrome new window, go to localhost:8080
5. You should see the login page
6. sign up and login
7. select file to upload(MUST be a business card)
8. WAIT A FEW MINUTES (the picture is not compressed so waiting time now is long)
9. The page should go to card information with address as clickable
10. Click the address to show map (WITHOUT the Contact address at this time)

****Please go over the code and see how express, nodejs, and mongodb works together, we need to write more functions****
